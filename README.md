FeedToVote  
FeedToVote is an educational website designed to explain how social media algorithms shape what people see online and how that can influence political motivation and voting behavior. The project breaks down how feeds filter information, how echo chambers form, and why certain posts rise to the top. The goal is to help users understand how curated digital environments affect real-world choices.

## Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to help young voters and social-media-first audiences become more intentional about the information they consume. Instead of passively scrolling, users learn to slow down, question what they see, and verify information before voting. The project combines visuals, research summaries, and interactive navigation to make complex ideas clear and accessible.

## Audience  
The intended audience is young voters, first-time voters, and social media users who may not realize how heavily curated their feeds are. The project is designed to be accessible, visual, and easy to navigate.

## Argument  
The central argument of this project is that social media platforms are not neutral. Feeds are algorithmically shaped in ways that influence what users believe is normal, common, or important. Over time, these filtered experiences can shift motivation, shape political attitudes, or discourage voting. By learning how feeds work and checking information beyond social media, users can become more informed and intentional voters.

Built with:

- CSS Modules

- Responsive mobile-first layouts  

## Writer’s Note  
FeedToVote aims to make complex ideas about algorithms and political communication understandable for everyday users. By combining research with visual examples and actionable tools, the site encourages people to think critically about their feeds and make informed choices when participating in democracy.
